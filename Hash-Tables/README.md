### Hash Tables(Objects, Dictionary, Hash - depending on the language)
 - Hash Tables uses hashing algorithms( md5, sha-256) to map keys to values in the program.
 - key is converted to jebrish number which present memory location of values.
 - Hashing optimized to be fast.

### Time complexity for different operations
 - Insert: O(1)
 - Delete: O(1)
 - Lookup: O(1)
 - Search: O(1)

 ### Hash Collisions
 - When two keys are mapped to the same location or hash number.
 - Can be solved using separate hashing technique
